## Personality 

## Backstory 

Synopsis: Juliet was an average college student, with decent grades, great friends and a love for cheer and her school. One night where Juliet was tasked as the designated driver and “mom friend” of a group of 4 of her girl friends going to a party. Juliet arrived late to the party finding 3 of her 4 friends already drunk, when inquiring where the 4th went she was told that her friends Jennifer had walked off with a member of the football team to the drinks table. Juliet made her way to the table and saw no sign of her, so  feeling the pit in her stomach grow she began checking rooms. All the rooms she came across where empty until she was at the second to last door, pressing her ear to the door she heard hushed voices, alarmed she pushed the door open to see Jennifer unconscious on the bed with 2 men standing beside the bed. She took hold of the situation and seeing that nothing had seemed to have happened yet something was about to. She stepped backwards bumping into a large man’s chest. The quarterback, she had bumped into the quarterback, he shoved her down as she fell her head hit the dresser corner before falling and smashing into a pile of weights. The last thing she her before passing out was “We have to get rid of her, that’s Juliet Kennedy you fucking morons”. Fading in an out of consciousness in the back of a car with a hand placed against her neck gripping tight, Juliet fading in and out as the boys stopped the car opened the doors and dragged her to the edge. Bickering between the boys continued before the quarterback grabbed her firmly by the neck off the ground raised her and squeezed one last time before throwing her into the rainy abyss below the cliff. Juliet’s body was found several days later by the witch (undetermined name) whilst she was out herb hunting in the forest. Feeling sympathy and sorrow for the young girl she brought her corpse pack to Dia Luna and buried her in her backyard. She cared for the grave placing flowers there everyday as well as nurturing the surrounding soil with herbs and roots from her concoctions. Until one day whilst tending the the lilies by Juliet’s grave the ground broke open a partial decomposed hand sprouting from the soil like a flower. Juliet had returned and clawed her way out of the soil with the witches help. The witch excited that she had created a zombie from such a long dead corpse was ecstatic about Juliet and showed no hesitation in helping her build her new life in Dia Luna.
### Full story:
Juliet is a semi newly turned zombie, who originally was your typical college girl, part of a sorority, working towards her degree in nursing, planning events centered around her adult cheer squad and enjoying time with her friends at parties and school events. She was well known around her campus a puller of positivity and encouragement, who was very involved with the school.Juliet story starts out on a day like any other for her, she’s finished classes for the day and is getting ready for a party her friends were invited to to be their designated driver and mom friend of the party. After arriving at the party Juliet met up with 3 of her 4 friends to check in on them, they were all quite tipsy and didn’t know where their fourth went. Juliet learned from her friend Katlyn that the missing fourth friend Jennifer had been last seen walking towards the drinks table with a member of the football team. Juliet made her way through the party searching for Jennifer getting more and more worried each corner she durned and eat each door she checked. Until she came upon one of the final doors in the hallway. Behind this door were hushed voices in low tones, Juliet braced herself and pushed the door open to see Jennifer passed out on the bed  with 2 larger men standing beside her. Her eyes darted around the room taking hold of the situation at hand, she realized while nothing had happened yet something was about to and she needed to get out now, someone had to know, she had to tell someone. Falling backwards out of the door she bumped into the large chest of the fourth member of this group. Juliet whipped her head back to meet the gaze of the quarterback who then proceeded to shove her to the ground. As her head fell her head landed on something hard, which went from dry to something warm, something wet. The room spun, her head felt hot she heard whispered shouting between the players about what to do about her. The room slowly turning darker and darker as she heard the last words out of the quarterbacks mouth “ We need to get rid of her, that’s Juliet Kennedy you fucking morons.” Her head felt warm and wet against the cold leather car seat hushed whispers coming from the two boys in the front seat speaking to an overpowering presence holding her neck down in the backseat.  The boy driving was speaking to the person in the back seat, “My dads gonna kill me those seats are real leather Marcus.” He turned his head back to meet Juliet’s eyes halting his speech before taking a sharp inhale


# Cutscenes 

## Early Game
Don’t know how we are gonna implement these just yet but one of the first ones I want the #PC  to experience after meeting Juliet. The #PC  will come across Juliet in her garden where she will call the #PC  over. “ Hey! #PC !” She waves her right arm in the air slightly vigorously excited to see the #PC and potentially make a new friend.  If the #PC chooses to interact with the cutscene, it will begin for real. In the middle of her waving her arm would snap off and fall into the creek next to her flower patch floating slowly towards the #PC.  Both Juliet and the #PC will be shocked by this and Juliet will begin speaking to the #PC with her shocked portrait “Whoops!”  Next dialogue box with her embarrassed portrait “Hey sorry, you mind grabbing that for me?” The #PC can choose between three dialogue options “Your arm came off!!!” Or “Was that your arm that just fell in the creek?” Or “ For all options Juliet will respond by standing up with a slight wobble and then continue forward with the following dialogue depending on what the player has said, If the player chooses “Your arm came off!!!” Juliet will respond “Hey, Hey! Don’t worry it’s fine! I can just snap it back on!” With a sheepish smile. If the #PC chooses
