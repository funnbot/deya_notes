# Context
#PC has two items related to farming, a hoe for tilling the land and a watering can for watering crops. This mechanic will be one of the main ways that the #PC will be able to acquire wealth through selling, potentially maybe a spell casting or potion making mechanic after crops have been harvested? But baseline #PC is caring for harvesting and selling crops.
## Hypothesis
Mechanically this will be one of the biggest features of the game it’s going to be the way the player makes money and potentially if we do the potions thing it will lead to another feature
