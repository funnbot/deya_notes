# Farming ideas
I like the idea of water magic instead of a watering can
#PC  maybe can summon a little mouse that tills the land 
No real time simulation, days have a static like 24 minutes total
It’s probably gonna be tedious in the beginning cause #PC will be using their magic on one tile at a time

## loops?
Npc is on the farm and requests specific items and #PC gets rewarded for planting and growing those items.
