# Farming ideas

- #PC has magic that can be used to till land and water crops
	- #PC presses shift M1 to activate spell
	-  #PC has a spell wheel that can be scrolled through with scroll wheel or fine positioned with number keys
	-  #PC holds shift to bring up the wheel menu (later when there are more spells you’ll have like a set amount of spell slots and you can mix and match for what you need)
		- the spell wheel is its own separate entity different from the inventory 
-  inventory, the #PC will have an inventory that can contain items like seeds, decorations and crops 
	- Accessing this inventory can be triggered with the E key
	-  when #PC 
- #PC objective is to upgrade these magical abilities to make planting and watering less tedious
- #PC can upgrade magic using some sort of crafting system to make spells or potions that upgrade their farming abilities
- #PC has a set amount of energy in the day that can be refilled but refilling becomes less effective the later it gets
	- #PC can reset this by sleeping for an amount of time 
	- idk how much time though.
- when #PC sleeps time moves forward, maybe a set amount?
- #PC can also earn money from selling the crops they grow and potions they make, to decorate their farm


I like the idea of water magic instead of a watering can
#PC maybe can summon a little mouse that tills the land 
No real time simulation, days have a static like 24 minutes total
It’s probably gonna be tedious in the beginning cause #PC will be using their magic on one tile at a time
more mystical than stardew, less tools and more magic.
Maybe starting the alchemy could be good? Like the #PC plants and grows crops to make into potions and spells that speed up the process so they can “win” faster?

I think a day time and energy meter

Maybe each “action” the #PC  does costs 1 energy or something and they only have like 30 energy

Incentive could be learning about a character or growing wealth or gaining decorations ?

Punishment for not going to next day

Crops grow overnight

## loops?
Npc is on the farm and requests specific items and #PC gets rewarded with money and maybe a decoration for planting and growing those items. 

#PC tills soil, #PC plants crop, #PC waters crop, #PC repeats watering until harvest, #PC harvests crop, #PC brings crop to cauldron, #PC begins experimenting with potions, #PC makes a potion that increases their mouse count or range of their water magic, #PC plants new crops to start the cycle again


### Ideal player day?
#PC wakes up and begins loop

## punishments 

Maybe #PC can eat food to regain energy but has a hunger bar that fills up so they have to stop eating once they’re full and therefore go to the next day for an empty stomach

Or maybe over the course of eating food to regain energy it does less and less as the day goes on 

## incentives

Decorations
Money
Friendship
Skill gain
New spells 
More magic

Maybe for current build the incentive could be making a certain amount of money by the end of 7 days?
