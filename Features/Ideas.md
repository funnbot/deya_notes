# Farming ideas

- #PC has magic that can be used to till land and water crops
	- #PC presses shift M1 to activate spell
	-  #PC has a spell wheel that can be scrolled through with scroll wheel or fine positioned with number keys
	-  #PC holds shift to bring up the wheel menu (later when there are more spells you’ll have like a set amount of spell slots and you can mix and match for what you need)
		- the spell wheel is its own separate entity different from the inventory 
		- Spells can be applied in the surrounding 3x3 area around a the player. Meaning if a #PC  has a crop 1 tile to the right of them they can hover over that near by tile and activate their watering spell to water the crop
-  inventory, the #PC will have an inventory that can contain items like seeds, decorations and crops 
	- Accessing this inventory can be triggered with the E key
	-  when #PC has an object in hand it can be placed in their general area of 3x3 tiles, its orientation (if applicable) can be fine tuned by hovering over a tile in the players 3x3 reach and pressing M1, to remove the item (if applicable press M2 while hovering over the item to return it to #PC inventory)
		- stardews rotation controls are bad, need dedicated mappings.
	- Inventory isn’t big yet 10 slots for now, shown on the lower/bottom half of the screen centered 
	-  #PC can use scroll wheel to move through inventory quickly or fine tune with number keys 1-10
		- Inventory will take priority over magic wheel scroll, unless #PC  is holding shift, the inventory cursor will only move in the players inventory not the spell wheel.
- When hovering over an item a small text box will describe the item, this text box will be to the items right
- crafting
	- #PC can hover over the cauldron and press M2 to interact with it
		- Interacting with it will cause the crafting menu to pop up
		- #PC can read item descriptions and make assumptions about the ingredients and how they interact. An example would be while hovering over an item a the #PC reads that mystic corn is the favorite food of tilling mice (the kind you summon to till your land with your spells) the #PC also reads that mirror lilies aid in duplication so the #PC moves the items from their inventory by clicking with M1 and moving it with the cursor to drop them in the cauldron, (maybe a bit of stirring animation, or some fanfare) and the #PC now no longer has the 2 previous items but instead  in the #PC inventory will now be something like super tilling mice feed that the player can use to upgrade/increase their number of tilling mice to +1 or something 
		- With 2 tilling mice the #PC can now till 4tiles total instead of 1 in a 2x2 plot in front of the player 
			- Potentially placement of the mice could very by players facing direction
		- The same can happen for the watering spell just with different ingredients
-  #PC can take these crafted items and use them only once, to get an additional upgrade they will need to create a stronger version of the previous craftable item.
		- #PC can also sell these lesser craftable items for a bit more than the sum of their parts to make more money than just selling the corn or lily on its own.
-  #PC 
- #PC objective is to upgrade these magical abilities to make planting and watering less tedious
- #PC can upgrade magic using some sort of crafting system to make spells or potions that upgrade their farming abilities
- #PC has a set amount of energy in the day that can be refilled but refilling becomes less effective the later it gets
	- a mana meter maybe for using your spells.
	- #PC can reset this by sleeping for an amount of time 
	- idk how much time though.
- when #PC sleeps time moves forward, maybe a set amount?
- #PC can also earn money from selling the crops they grow and potions they make, to decorate their farm
	- #PC can hold items out by having their inventory curser over them and place them with M1, and remove them to have the, fall back in their inventory with M2. This placement range is the same range the #PC always has for themselves, which is a 3x3 tile area with the middle tile being the tile the player is standing in. Anywhere in this 3x3 area the #PC can place items by clicking M1 on the exact tile they want or if cursor is off screen the object will be placed directly in front of the #PC 


I like the idea of water magic instead of a watering can
#PC maybe can summon a little mouse that tills the land 
No real time simulation, days have a static like 24 minutes total
It’s probably gonna be tedious in the beginning cause #PC will be using their magic on one tile at a time
more mystical than stardew, less tools and more magic.
Maybe starting the alchemy could be good? Like the #PC plants and grows crops to make into potions and spells that speed up the process so they can “win” faster?

I think a day time and energy meter

Maybe each “action” the #PC  does costs 1 energy or something and they only have like 30 energy

Incentive could be learning about a character or growing wealth or gaining decorations ?

Punishment for not going to next day

Crops grow overnight

## loops?
Npc is on the farm and requests specific items and #PC gets rewarded with money and maybe a decoration for planting and growing those items. 

#PC tills soil, #PC plants crop, #PC waters crop, #PC repeats watering until harvest, #PC harvests crop, #PC brings crop to cauldron, #PC begins experimenting with potions, #PC makes a potion that increases their mouse count or range of their water magic, #PC plants new crops to start the cycle again


### Ideal player day?
#PC wakes up and begins loop

## punishments 

Maybe #PC can eat food to regain energy but has a hunger bar that fills up so they have to stop eating once they’re full and therefore go to the next day for an empty stomach

Or maybe over the course of eating food to regain energy it does less and less as the day goes on 

## incentives

Decorations
Money
Friendship
Skill gain
New spells 
More magic

Maybe for current build the incentive could be making a certain amount of money by the end of 7 days?
