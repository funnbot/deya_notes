# Farming ideas
I like the idea of water magic instead of a watering can
#PC  maybe can summon a little mouse that tills the land 
No real time simulation, days have a static like 24 minutes total
It’s probably gonna be tedious in the beginning cause #PC will be using their magic on one tile at a time
Maybe starting the alchemy could be good? Like the #PC plants and grows crops to make into potions and spells that speed up the process so they can “win” faster?

I think a day time and energy meter are good ideas as I don’t wanna do rts

Maybe each “action” the #PC  does costs 1 energy or something and they only have like 30 energy

Incentive could be learning about a character or growing wealth or gaining decorations ?

Punishment for not going to next day

## loops?
Npc is on the farm and requests specific items and #PC gets rewarded with money and maybe a decoration for planting and growing those items. 

#PC tills soil, #PC plants crop, #PC waters crop, #PC repeats watering until harvest, #PC harvests crop, #PC brings crop to cauldron, #PC begins experimenting with potions, #PC makes a potion that increases their mouse count or range of their water magic, #PC plants new crops to start the cycle again
