# Summary

**Describe your game in one sentence**
A creepy cute monster themed farming simulator.
Then write one or two paragraphs summarizing your game.

Player character is a paranormal investigator going to the town of Dia Luna, upon initial explorations player character runs into the town‚Äôs witch and bumping into her knocking a handful of rare newts and toads out of her basket while completely unaware of her presence as player character was attempting to get a photograph of something rustling in the bushes near by. Player character is startled and covered in amphibians and attempts to collect them before they scurry off to no avail. The witch displeased and enraged that she just lost a large ingredient haul curses the player altering their appearance to a monster (I haven‚Äôt picked yet) before flying off, knocking player character unconscious in the process. Time passes and player character is woken up by honey (maybe?) and she doesn‚Äôt even know that player character was once human she immediately assumes they‚Äôre a displaced monster and brings them to  #DiaLuna 
Add an image of video of your game here that demonstrates what the game is like.
