# Game loops

Enjoy idle conversation and building relationships with npcs, potentially even romantic relationships : loop: talk to npc->learn more about them-> become friends or romantically inclined 

Explore colorful dungeons for loots and special items to help you get stronger: loop: #PC  wishes to get a specific item-> #PC goes to where item is in dungeon, #PC either acquires desired item or isn’t strong enough yet and there for-> #PC builds skill to defeat creatures in the dungeon easier-> #PC acquires desired item-> with new found strength there are now better items to reach for and #PC repeats the process. Loop: enter dungeon-> mine ores or gather loot-> become stronger to access more valuable items and resources.

Farming, the #PC can till the land or ranch special monstery animals to gain their products, these products sell for money which the #PC can use to upgrade their farm, buy gifts for npcs, or decorate their living space! Loop: #PC wants to upgrade farm or buy item-> #PC grows and waters crops to produce product to sell or nurtures animals to gain product to sell-> #PC sells product and gains money-> #PC is able to upgrade farm or purchase the item they want with new gold.

Unsure about this one but artifact sifting/finding shinies is one of my favorite activities in games and irl so maybe a sifting or panning mini game where the player can gain access to rare materials, artifacts and gems by sifting through archeological digs. I potentially want a mummy character who’s an archeologist to run some kind of museum like fossils in animal crossing or artifacts in stardew. Maybe she can start out with a couple exhibits but due to lacking funds and she’s the only one working the collection is small so #PC can help build the collection! Loop: Mummy asks for artifacts to help add to the town’s museum and culture-> pc (hopefully) wants to help and get artifacts-> #PC gains access to the sifter and pan so they can play a sifting minigame-> maybe player can choose to dry or wet sift, and click/tap different parts of the screen to create movement in the sifter-> sifted objects are then lightly cleaned by the #PC and identified by the mummy-> once donated #PC can admire their collection with an interesting fact attached to each item (might want to think more on the sifting minigame cause idk how much other p)


In here write down your game loops. What does your player do moment by moment?

For example:

**Navigate a maze**

The player can move up, down, left or right in a maze.

**Avoid ghosts**

The player has to avoid ghosts that follow them in the maze.

**Clear the dots in the maze**
