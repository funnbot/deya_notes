 #The_Monster_Realm "the monster realm" is a physical place in the human world its not some alternate world or reality, the town of Dia Luna is a town that's nestled in the crest of a deep cut valley somewhere in idk like Oregon or smthn idk , maybe ill make a fake world to go with this too idk. It is surrounded by large forests and shimmering mountains the closest entrance in the human realm is a long isolated road that curves around one of the mountains. The road itself is in no way connected to the town as it is essentially parallel to the town as well as above it as the town is in a gully
