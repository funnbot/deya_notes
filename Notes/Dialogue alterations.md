## Juliet's alterations

The point of these small dialogue and cutscene alterations is not to punish or deprive masc/male players of content but rather to show through visual and written storytelling that Juliet distrusts men and those who present as such. The content will always be either made up of in a different fashion like instead of a direct invite for fem/NB #PC , masc/male #PC will receive a letter as an invite the content will be the same in the end just written ever so slightly differently. Juliet's treatment of the play most likely will change based off of what pronouns they are currently using cause idk how to incorporate presentation into a togglable menu without it sounding weird ig??? Maybe like the pronoun menu it can just be a dropdown thing and if you have either of the following toggled (Pronouns: He/Him, He/They or Presentation Masc) she'll interact with the player like this? Like the dropdown could be Pronouns: He/Him, He/They, They/Them, She/Her, She/They or write your own for the last one idgaf, and then Presentation: Masc, None, Fem Idk if this is too complicated but I want to both be inclusive as well as showing dynamic character development. So far in my character development Juliet is the only character who is distrustful of a group of people based off trauma so I don't think I'm going to be utilizing this feature for most if any of the other characters I want to create.
